# Analysis  

The dashboard identifies biases and outliers in the data, helping the organisation make informed decisions to reduce attrition rates and enhance employee retention.

- **'Employee Count' Filtered to Highlight 'Store Management'**

<img width="549" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-22 at 09 01 43" src="https://github.com/AJAnalyticsHub/Employee_Attrition/assets/168544313/aeb3cf0b-744c-4e8b-8e0f-f559acfc094f">

The data shows an 88.57% reduction in management positions since 2006. 
This year's attrition rate stands at 66.67%, attributed to 3 layoffs and 5 retirements. 
It is recommended to initiate a hiring drive to fill management roles.

- **'Average Length of Service and Age' Filtered to Highlight 'Resignations'**

<img width="546" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 09 37 39" src="https://github.com/AJAnalyticsHub/Employee_Attrition/assets/168544313/a00597f0-e27a-4bb0-b238-f32e097726e1">

The average length of service before resignation is approximately five years, aligning with the UK market average. 
This suggests a positive organisational culture. 
However, a deeper analysis of resignation reasons is necessary to provide specific recommendations for improving tenure.

- **'Age Range of Employees' Filtered to Highlight 'Customer Service'**

<img width="349" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 10 00 25" src="https://github.com/AJAnalyticsHub/Employee_Attrition/assets/168544313/215048d0-ec14-48fc-bd5a-8bd77a2dc861">

The analysis reveals a growing trend of younger employees joining the workforce as the department expands.

Filtering further to highlight 'Resignations':

<img width="351" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 10 07 17" src="https://github.com/AJAnalyticsHub/Employee_Attrition/assets/168544313/71df0aa6-78eb-43de-857e-31074d0a1879">

This analysis reveals that a significant majority of resignations occur within the '18-25' age bracket.
However, the overall attrition rate is 3.93% which is far below the UK average 15% rate. 
Once again this suggests a positive organisational culture.

<img width="543" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 10 07 35" src="https://github.com/AJAnalyticsHub/Employee_Attrition/assets/168544313/bc5e47ff-06ec-4f43-bf7a-83a2910a2d39">

Employees that resigned between the years 2008 to 2014 had an average length of service of 2 years, which is below the UK average of 5 years.
In contrast, the average length of service in 2015 increased to 6 years. 
It is recommended to conduct further analysis to determine if this improvement can be sustained in the coming year.

- **'Years of Service' Box and Whisker Plot Filtered to Highlight 'Gender'**

<img width="604" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 10 35 52" src="https://github.com/AJAnalyticsHub/Employee_Attrition/assets/168544313/c4183598-dea9-4288-9a14-763c78f1d7df">

The length of service between female and male employees is statistically similar. 
Female employees have average, median, and upper quartile values that are only one year higher than their male counterparts. 
This analysis indicates that the organisation promotes equal opportunities regarding gender.

<img width="254" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 10 39 51" src="https://github.com/AJAnalyticsHub/Employee_Attrition/assets/168544313/9d0d2287-b188-4652-b019-ce9de54cbe44">

This conclusion is further supported by an overall gender ratio of 52:48 between female and male employees.

## Conclusion

This attrition dashboard analyses employee data to look at trends and anomalies to provide actionable recommendations and highlights areas that are in need of further analysis.
